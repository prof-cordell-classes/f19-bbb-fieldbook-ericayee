## Station Eleven and the Lincoln Bible

In his book project presentation, Anson used _Station Eleven_ by Emily St. John Mandel as one of his examples because the post-apocalyptic fiction novel establishes a relationship with author through ideas, emotions, and characters. He labeled the book as a traditionally published in format and process, including through a book tour. This aspect gave me pause because although I agree book tours are part of the conventional mainstream publishing process, I hadn't thought about the concept at all during this class. As it would turn out, I loved _Station Eleven_ so much when I read it in high school that I attended Emily St. John Mandel's book tour event when she came near where I lived. Remembering this experience made me think about different kinds of author-reader relationships. In my own book project, which focused on the same quote as Anson, my examples of author-reader relationships were more abstract — such as 17th century Japanese authors writing about topics they thought their audience would be interested in. Some other classmates have mentioned how creators of media like web comics may interact with their readers in comment sections, yet another type of relationship.

Maybe I hadn't thought of book tours in this context because they are relatively rare occurrences of encountering books and authors in the big picture. The number of readers who will see a popular author in person must be miniscule compared to the number of those who read the book. Besides marketing and promotion, what is the purpose of tours? So readers can feel "closer" to an author? So the author can reveal more about their process? I guess it varies widely depending on the personality of the author and their view towards whether their books should stand alone and be totally up to reader interpretation. I don't remember anything Emily St. John Mandel said at her event, though I can still picture it in my mind. Coming face-to-face with the "physical manifestation" of an author whose words I've read is actually pretty wild to me, now that I think about it. The line between creator and creation blurs a little bit more when I realize that every character and line of dialogue came from the mind of someone sitting at the front of the room. I'm not sure how that changes my relationship with her book, if it does at all. I may ascribe more value to the specific text that she autographed (though it has since been lost in the mail), but that text is not even the one I actually read (which was the Kindle version).

Switching topics, I was intrigued by the class discussion comparing the 3D-printed Lincoln life mask versus a marble bust, or even the Lincoln Memorial. The group discussed how different materials and context can give different connotations. Someone else said maybe we feel closer to the source/original because we know it was actually made from a mold that touched his face. This got me thinking about the Lincoln Bible, which was owned by the president. I remember at least Presidents Obama and Trump swore on it during their inaugurations, if not other presidents as well. Similar to our observations about the mask, the context that Lincoln owned and presumably handled this particular text is what gives it significance. Though many presidents have placed their hand on a Bible while taking the oath of office, I think they can use any book. With our country's separation of church and state, maybe swearing on the Constitution would actually make more sense. But there's something about the heft of a vintage, leather-bound Bible — especially one owned by one of the most famed presidents — that seems really special in our culture.
