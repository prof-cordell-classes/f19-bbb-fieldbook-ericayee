# Reflective: Zines

## A few thoughts on zines

The main theme I got from our readings and discussions this week is that the creators of zines put so much of themselves, even sometimes the messiness, into their products. In addition to Pagan Kennedy's book, most of the ones I flipped through from Giordana Mecagni's collection felt extremely personal and sincere. Honestly, at some points I felt like I was learning more than I wanted to know about the creators. A classmate called zines a place where the author could be completely self-indulgent. One zine we perused together in class exemplified this: The author kept signing everything with her name on each page. To be fair, I don't think I'm the target audience of most of the zines we looked at because I didn't know the creators personally. I'm also viewing them a decade or two after their creation, and as Giordana mentioned, zines were often seen as ephemeral — products of their time.

Another theme that struck me this week was how low the barriers to entry for creating zines are, especially after our unit using the big letterpress equipment. Of course the extent of time and effort that a creator pours into their zine can be extreme. The student work (Kaitlin?) Professor Cordell passed around clearly required much dedication and work. But we also could make a semblance of a zine in 30 minutes in class using a single piece of paper. One zine from Giordana's collection was created by a 19-year-old, someone younger than me. I even saw on Giordana's website that her 8-year-old daughter created [one](https://giordanamecagni.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/eastie-rats-zine.pdf) to promote her skateboard club in East Boston.

Finally, I've been thinking a lot about how the content of a zine is formed as I try to come up with my project idea. My initial project idea was to have a single narrative story played out together in both a zine and online. However, upon further thought, I realized that most of the zines we looked at seem to be collections of various, not necessarily related content — different poems, different short stories, etc. This is, of course, how the content of most magazines is also presented. So, in the spirit of zine culture, would I instead want mine to contain a few short stories instead of one longer one? On the other hand, zines are inherently meant to be counter-cultural and boundary-pushing. This quandary goes back to a question that's been behind some of our class discussion so far this semester: How much does the content inform the form, and vice versa? Since at this stage in my project I don't already have a clear idea for my story narrative (except that it will include multiple paths of some sort), I think my general ideas for content and form will inform each other.
