## Hope and webtoons

One of my reading prep observations mused about what forms books will exist in when the Future Library will be published and read. Will our species still be printing paper pages? After our brief class discussion on Wednesday, I went back to the _Times_ article and searched for the word "hope." It shows up eight times in the article, which at one point juxtaposes the hope underwriting the Future Library with "a near apocalyptic sense of doom." It is these conflicting yet simultaneous senses that came to mind when I was looking at Miranda Maher's work in the Northeastern collection of artist's books.

The content of Maher's books chronicles violence and hostile conflicts we have inflicted on our fellow human beings. But even in these critical looks at the our society, there is some inherent optimism — even hope? — in her work. She must have some optimism to keep creating updated editions of similar content, even as she keeps finding more and more instances of violence to include. I think her author's statement in _After Reasonable Research_ spoke to these sentiments. Maybe she'll be able to include some times of peace in next edition. But probably not.

After Stephanie and I both mentioned Charles Dickens in our book report presentations this week, Professor Cordell told us about how Dickens actually included a preface and the other "final" parts of the book in the last installment mailed out to subscribers so that could be bound together. This got me thinking about trying to follow a storyline given in weekly or monthly doses — would I remember what had previously happened? I'm not sure if Dickens included recaps of previous events in his installments, but I know that many of the "webtoons," or digital comics, I read do. This can be helpful if I'm following the story as it is updated. On the other hand, it can be annoying if I'm binge-reading many episodes of a story at once, and the recaps repeat what I just read. Just like if I read Dickens now, I'm not reading webtoons in their exact original format. So if reading webtoons the way they are originally meant to — in installments — these recaps are almost integral to the format. If I'm not reading them as updated, this "feature" can create more confusion. However, they can easily be skipped through if I don't want to look at them.
