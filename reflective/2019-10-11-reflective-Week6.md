# Reflective: Binding

## Some judgment on book covers

In class, we discussed the concept of judging book by their covers in Charles W. Chesnutt's “Baxter’s Procustes.” I understand that a book's format may not reflect the content (hence the saying "don't judge..."), especially when we think about how books were made historically. However, as a kid I would wander through library aisles and only pick books to read based on their covers. There were so many options — shelves and shelves of them — how else was I supposed to choose? And as we read in "How to design an awarded letterpress printed book," sometimes it's okay that physical characteristics of a book overshadow the story within. With the rise of ebooks, I wonder if covers matter as much to some people now, both publishers and readers. If I think about my own habits, I probably don't linger on covers as much when they are just a small rectangular picture on my phone screen or just a black-and-white rectangle on my Kindle.

On a related topic, I tend to dislike seeing books rereleased with covers featuring a picture from the movie adaptation. Seeing the actors makes it harder for me to imagine my own interpretation of what the characters look like, which is kind of why I like reading fiction books in the first place. Additionally, sometimes the aesthetic of the cover gets changed dramatically and no longer matches the tone of the book. This is not to say that I think the original cover is always the best, but for me, the cover of the edition that I originally read can leave a lasting impression on how I remember the book.

On a more unrelated topic, I thought that the rhetorical question brought up in class about how much money publishers have made over time selling Karl Marx's manifesto was really interesting. Where does the content of a book fit within the larger publication? I believe this goes back to some of the first vocabulary words we learned in this class: the difference between a _work_, our abstract notion of a text/content, and a _text_, a specific artifact. As a Christian, this makes me thinks about how Bibles are published today compared to the past. Though the work is still considered a sacred text to many, mass printing technologies have changed the texts we actually own and handle on a daily basis.

While both are a far cry from the illuminated manuscripts made in monasteries several hundred years ago, my own two physical Bibles are still vastly different from each other. One is a hefty study Bible whose cover and binding are meant to look like leather but feel hard. The other is a small, soft, portable copy that I think is supposed to feel like imitation leather. Though the main content inside is exactly the same, both try to evoke the animal skin covers of books past in almost opposite ways.
