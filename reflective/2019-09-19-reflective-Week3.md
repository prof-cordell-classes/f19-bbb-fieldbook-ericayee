## The imperfections of the printing process and printed products

A common thread through this week's readings was the irony of how the printing press allowed for perfect copies, but also couldn't actually be always perfect. As Glenn Fleishman wrote in [How Letterpress Printing Came Back from the Dead](https://www.wired.com/story/how-letterpress-printing-came-back-from-the-dead/), "it’s impossible to achieve completely consistent results." I can't help thinking about how inkjet and laser printers today get us even closer to perfect copies — but they too are vulnerable to running out of ink or breaking mechanically (as anyone who's ever tried to print from a Northeastern printer knows..). And instead of accidentally dropping type out of the composing stick or galley (?), today we might have to deal with something corrupted in the process of sending a job to print electronically. Technology may change, but we can still count on frustrations with whatever we have now.

Now onto my experience with using the letterpress type in class. Due to limited number of composing sticks, I worked with a partner for this first foray. My fellow compositor and I took turns searching for letters in the case and setting type into the stick. When we started, we didn't have an idea in mind of what we were printing. This already violated the first step, "Sketch the design," in the [how-to guide](https://inkbotdesign.com/letterpress-printing/) from the class readings. We just tossed some words around. Though it slowed us down, this approach also allowed us more flexibility because we didn't have an exact idea of what we wanted. For example, at one point, we decided to use parentheses or brackets. However, the case we had of Franklin Gothic type didn't have any. If I had been a compositor a few hundred years ago setting a client's manuscript on deadline, I would've been stuck and very stressed (though I guess most parentheses could probably be shared between fonts, now that I think about it). Fortunately, this wasn't our situation, so we just passed on using the parentheses. Additionally, although we didn't work with ink yet, I noticed my fingers and underneath my nails still got dirty from the type.

Even in our brief time with the type on Wednesday, this quote by Lindsay Lynch in [How I Came to Love the En Space](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/09/how-i-came-to-love-the-en-space/499337/) especially came to life for me.

> [The en space] is never seen, but without it, everything printed would be nonsense."

 My partner and I did not know which space we wanted to use out of the available offerings: em quad, en quad, 3-to-em, 4-to-em. I think we initially used en quad for some of our spaces between words, with no reasoning beside it seemed to look alright. But when we had to fill in the rest of the line beside the letters, we couldn't find a good combination of spaces that seemed tight enough. So we swapped the en quad piece for either a 3-to-em or two 4-to-ems, which seemed to fit the remaining space better. Though I never think about these choices when typing in word processors, it did recall the "letter-spacing" CSS property in web development. Interestingly, the newsroom developers at my previous co-op still referred to this property as "kerning" as a holdover from print newspaper terminology.
