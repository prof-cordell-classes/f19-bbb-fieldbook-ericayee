I enjoyed the class exercise in which every student wrote one of their reading prep questions on the board as the basis for discussion. One topic I don't think we discussed in class but that had a few questions was Ellen Lupton's labeling of "type crimes" in her book _Thinking With Type_. One classmate asked:

> What "laws" is Lupton upholding when she calls typographical choices "type crimes"?

Another asked:

> To what extent is art subjective in the context of type? Are "type crimes" acceptable given a certain creative purpose?

When I was reading this book, I recall taking these labels as rules for good design. I didn't think much of them past that. But these questions, along with the rest of our discussion about utilitarian vs. aesthetic aspects of fonts, made me think more about this labeling. Lupton even goes so far as to call pseudo small caps in Helvetica "an abomination against nature" on pg. 52. While her tone may be intended as a bit flippant, the implication of the first classmate's question is a good point. These "laws" are human constructs — and perhaps also Western aesthetics. Lupton's "corrections" to type crimes do look more pleasing to the eye and are generally easier to read, for sure. But again, that's not always the point of playing with type.

Another topic that intrigued me was the class discussion of certain fonts in branding, particularly for Glossier and Supreme. A significant reason for the recognizability of these company's logo is the font choice. It's interesting that these two brands were brought up in class because they have many similarities. Both logos use sans-serif fonts with some weight and slight italics. I don't know anything about Glossier's reputation as a makeup company or who its target audience is, but I wonder if it's in any way similar to Supreme's as a skater clothing brand. You wouldn't know what either company sells merely from seeing their logos. But at least to me, the logos give off sleek, simple, "cool" vibes.

In his book report presentation, Levi spoke about one definition of a book as a "protean kaleidoscope" from Zuzana Husárová. The gist of this definition is that if all aspects of a book are included, there's nothing a book cannot be. But, if I understood correctly, Levi said that he doesn't fully agree with this statement. For example, he doesn't think a grain of sand is a book. I wrote down that his own definition was that "a book is a definition of feelings" (I'm not sure if that's exactly what he said though). There is no unique feeling for each grain of sand to him, so he doesn't consider them books. However, I wonder how something like a codex containing just a grain of sand on each page would fit under his definition. Does something about the form inherently make it a book? Or are essentially blank codices not books? Furthermore, what if each page instead had a photo of a different grain of sand — would this be a picture book? I'm not sure.
