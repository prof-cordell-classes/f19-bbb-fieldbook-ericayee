# Semester book project proposal

#### Erica Yee

### Content
My book will be a choose-your-own-adventure (CYOA) fiction story, probably revolving around a student in Boston.

### Format
I envision my book as a hybrid between a physical format and digitally interactive pages. I think the physical half will be a zine in order to better facilitate mass(ish) production (to distribute to my friends and family). But unlike classic CYOA books where the reader flips back and forth, I want the physical zine to be a linear experience. At certain milestones in the book, the reader has to scan a QR code in the zine that brings them to a website where some subsequents events in the story play out. I want the digital aspects to offer elements that a physical book can’t — i.e. be more than just text and pictures. One idea is some kind of random generator for the probability of something happening to the character (like rolling a die in Dungeons & Dragons). Or perhaps a “mad lib” where the user can randomly receive or input their own parts of the story. I’m not sure how this would affect the parts of the story that stay constant in the zine, but I think it would be cool to figure out a way that both contents could interplay with each other.

### Skills

I don't think I need any new skills for creating the zine, though my drawing skills could use a lot of work. I've done some web development in the past, so I feel like I have a good foundation for the digital portion. I expect to learn more as I just try to figure out different ways of storytelling I want to implement.

### Materials

I'm not sure yet if I will compile the zine by drawing/collage or digitally. Either way, the materials (paper, magazines, pens) can be found around campus or be easily purchased.

### Equipment

If I create the zine digitally, I will probably use [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), an in-browser design tool I've mocked up projects with before. My laptop is already setup for web development, and I will host the digital pages on my personal GitHub account.

### Team

This is an individual project.

### Evaluation plan

My goal for this book is for a reader to be able to follow the story by interacting with both the physical zine and digital pages. At the lowest level, we will know if these goals are met if these elements are present:
* a physical zine that can be distributed
* digital pages that can be accessed online
* a way of connecting to the digital pages from the zine (using a smartphone)
* narrative content with a beginning, middle, and end (ideally multiple possible endings)

At a higher level, my goal will be exceeded if these elements work together smoothly to provide an engaging and enjoyable experience for the reader. I'd like the interplay of the technologies to evoke a sense of wonder or surprise.

### General steps
1. Outline a narrative story with a protagonist, setting, conflict, and multiple resolutions.
2. Determine which aspects of the story would be most suitable for the zine or online
3. Mockup zine (dimensions? how many pages? what medium of creation? how will the QR codes look?)
4. Start coding digital pages
5. Iterate on zine and digital pages until they work together to my satisfaction
