# Semester book project: Proposal

#### Erica Yee

### Instructions
Outline the book project you hope to complete, as well as the steps required to do so. It might be nice to gather your materials about the project, so much as you can, in your repositories. If you create a new folder ("BookProject") you could put your proposal and other materials there and sync them just like you do for your fieldbook entries.

#### The content of your book. What will it be about?
My book will be a choose-your-own-adventure (CYOA) fiction story, probably revolving around a student in Boston.

#### The format of your book. Will it be printed and bound? A zine? An ebook? A hybrid? Something else?
I envision my book as a hybrid of physical and digitally interactive. I think the physical half will be a zine in order to better facilitate mass(er) production (to distribute to my friends and family). But unlike classic CYOA books where the reader flips back and forth, I want the physical zine to be a linear experience. At certain milestones in the book, the reader has to scan a QR code in the zine that brings them to a website where some subsequents events in the story play out. I want the digital aspects to offer elements that a physical book can’t — i.e. be more than just text. One idea is some kind of random generator for the probability of something happening to the character (like rolling a die in Dungeons & Dragons). Or perhaps a “mad lib” where the user can randomly receive or input their own parts of the story. I’m not sure how this would affect the parts of the story that stay constant in the zine, but I think it would be cool to figure out a way that both contents could interplay with each other.

#### The skills you will need in order to execute your project, as well as a plan for acquiring those skills, particularly if they are not skills we will formally study together. There will be class periods devoted to individual learning that can be used to facilitate such supplemental skill development.

#### The materials you will need to complete your project, as well as a plan for acquiring these materials.

#### The equipment you will need in order to complete your project, as well as a plan for accessing that equipment. Some of this equipment may be readily available through Huskiana Press (attached to our classroom), but even so you should outline a plan for use.

#### The team working on your book. Is this an individual or group project? If the latter, what does each member bring to the group?

#### A plan for evaluating the project. What are your goals for this book, and how will we know whether and to what extent those goals have been met?
