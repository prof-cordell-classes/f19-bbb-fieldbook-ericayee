# Reading Prep: Zines

#### Erica Yee

## Questions or Observations

1. On page 29 of _'Zine_, I like the picture Pagan Kennedy includes of one of her zines in which she drew herself into a photocopied picture of the family from _The Partridge Family_. This old-school "photoshop" job is creative and offers more insight into the author than a perfectly digitized version. The incongruity gives the mashup an off-beat sort of character, which seems to be what most zines are going for.

2. Beyond the actual content of the Zine Librarians Code of Ethics, I really like how its website offers the document in different formats: "beautiful zine format for printing (pdf), a Web-readable version, or as a boring Word document." The thought and intentionality put into even these options reflects the format as a whole. Though zines are usually meant to be experienced in a static physical format (from my understanding), this openness to make the code of ethics accessible for readers of different preferences parallels the tendency of zine culture to be counter-cultural and appeal to people in perhaps marginalized communities.

3. I think it's interesting that erasure poetry is named using a word with a more negative connotation, rather than something like "revelatory" poetry. I understand how it refers to crossing out the words you don't want to use. But I feel like it can also be viewed as revealing new poetry out of an unrelated source text. I wonder if the poets in the provided examples had ideas about what they wanted their poems to be about and found source material that provided relevant words, or if they picked a random book page, etc. to see what they could make out of the words that happened to be there.
