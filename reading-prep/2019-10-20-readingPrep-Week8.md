## Questions or Observations

1. In the [Scientific American article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/reading-paper-screens/), researcher Abigail Sellen says, "The implicit feel of where you are in a physical book turns out to be more important than we realized." I read books in both physical and digital formats, and one difference I'm struck by is how I can't tell how long a digital book is. A friend once recommended me the magical realism/histoical fiction novel _Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell_, which I read on my Kindle. But I don't think I ever would've started the book if I saw the physical edition because it's over a thousand pages and long books intimidate me (such a commitment!). While ebook readers/apps almost always tell you what percentage of the book you're through, they don't always have page numbers as we're used to in physical book. Some formats will only have "loc" locations which are pretty meaningless. Beside percentages and progress bars, is there a better way to show orient yourselves in digital texts?


2. The [Nautilus article](http://nautil.us/issue/32/space/the-deep-space-of-digital-reading) suggests that the iPad novella _Pry_ optimizes the strengths of its digital platform in the best ways. Then the author Paul La Farge says, "Most of the Web is not like _Pry_ â€” not yet, anyway." While I am excited about new kinds of storytelling on our digital devices, I'm not sure I want everything I look electronically to be super interactive. Maybe sometimes I just want text on a screen.

3. SB Nation's "[What Football Will Look Like in the Future](https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football/)" is incredible and mind-blowing. Beside the storytelling and entire premise, I'm impressed that all the multimedia parts work as expected on my 2019 browser that has some ad/JavaScript restrictions. The whole experience was a pleasure, and I didn't even mind all the scrolling. The same cannot be said for many more recently published websites. That says a lot about how much thought and effort was put into the development of this project as well as the content. I tested the first part on my phone, and seemed to work well there too.
