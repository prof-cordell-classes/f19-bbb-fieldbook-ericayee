# Reading Prep: E-lit 2

## Questions or Observations

1. Leonardo Flores defines electronic literature as "writing-centered art that engages the expressive potential of electronic and digital media." Until now, I never thought about comparing the words "literature" and "book" in the context of this class. How are they different? My gut says literature is a broader category, Flores says he counts memes as a kind of electronic literature. I see the case for this, while if he had said that memes count as an electronic book I would be much more skeptical.

2. What are "kinetic texts" as Flores mentions? From his example of kinetic writing occurring in lyric videos, I'm guessing it refers to animated words that appear in a sequence. If so, I wonder if this genre can also be applied to interactive chat games/literature. For example, in "What Football Will Look Like in the Future," at least one of the videos consists of following a "real-time" conversation between the satellites.

3. Throughout reading Flores's article about the different generations of electronic literature, I kept going back to the sad thought that some of these older works may no longer be available/accessible. We have cuneiform tablets from thousands of years ago. I'm pretty sure our descendants will still be able to hold and interact with physical codices. But they may not be able to run a floppy disk or play Flash-based games (this is already somewhat of a hassle). The introduction to "First Screening" talks about how the Apple IIe became obsolete and thus the poems created on it became "essentially inaccessible," though in this case they did get updated for newer technology platforms.
