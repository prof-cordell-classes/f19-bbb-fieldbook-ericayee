# Reading Prep: Binding

## Questions or Observations

1. In the _Print Magazine_ interview with Lindsay Schmittle of Gingerly Press, Schmittle talks about using found natural textures in her letterpress prints, like bark. The example photo looks really cool, but I'm wondering how the pressure of the printing process damages things like bark. If she's making multiple copies, does that mean she'll need many pieces of bark? Then each copy will look different, but that may be what she's going for.

2. When the researchers rip out book pages, fold them, and toss them into the water in "'Oh Look, a Ferry'; or the Smell of Printed Books," they discuss the shock of destroying a book. Our society has a "reverence surrounding the book object," they write, and even annotating them "requires confidence born from the possession of significant cultural capital." I relate to this feeling to an extent â€” growing up I was taught to take care of books, especially library books. On the other hand, I'm always a bit surprised when I resell used books to bookstores and they are worth so little. The prevalence of mass printing and low cost of materials these days just means in the grand scheme of things, the vast majority of books (as in codices) are just not that valuable.

3. I love the short video in "How to design an awarded letterpress printed book" showcasing the unusual "lay-flat binding." Watching the already-read section lower down the binding as pages flip is mesmerizing and almost mechanical-looking. I appreciate when physical books (or journals) lay flat, but I can see why it's way more work to make that happen.
