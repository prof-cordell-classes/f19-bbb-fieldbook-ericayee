# Reading Prep: Print I

## Questions or Observations

1. In _The Machine that Made Us_, we learn how Gutenberg originally wanted to print his entire original run of Bibles on vellum. But he realized this would require killing too many animal and ended up using paper for most of the books, though there are about a dozen printed on vellum. This made me wonder: **What environmental effects do our book-making processes have today?** A quick online search reveals that there is an [ongoing debate](https://theconversation.com/weighing-the-environmental-costs-buy-an-ereader-or-a-shelf-of-books-8331) between the costs of reading e-books vs. physical books. Both have significant energy, waste, and materials cost in similar and different ways. But it's hard to compare exact numbers. As we saw in the class fieldtrip to the Northeastern archives, books printed on vellum are much more durable than those printed on paper. I wonder how that factored into the historic environmental cost of making books over time.
2. I really liked Lindsay Lynch's 2016 article “How I Came to Love the En Space” in _The Atlantic_. Her passion for the topic was evident, and some of the facts — such as how we got spaces — were fascinating. Reading her discussion of spacing between letters and lines made me think about how our (speaking as a 21st century American) collective idea of standard margins came about. For almost every school paper I've written, my teachers have asked for 1-inch margins. I've also heard that some employers frown on resumes with smaller than that dimension because it looks like you're trying to somehow cheat the system by cramming more information into a one page resume. **Why did 1 inch become the standard?** Is it the most aesthetically pleasing? Just because it's a round number?
3. On the topic of margins, I have a few observations based on years of reading [Wired](https://www.wired.com), one of my favorite magazines and the only one for which I subscribe to the print version. One aspect of the print magazine that has always stuck out to me is the unusual margins — often narrower than expected or even essentially nonexistent. I don't always love the look, but I still like to see what edgy, boundary-pushing designs they come up with. Sometimes I think the layout looks too crowded or even hard to read because of the lack of margins and/or super narrow columns of text. But it's still interesting to contrast to the digital version of articles Online, where I mostly read Wired, all articles get the same basic treatment. Here's a comparison:
 #### A Wired article in print; notice some of the text is right against the edge of its surrounding box.

 #### The same article online; headline above a lead graphic above a column of text.
