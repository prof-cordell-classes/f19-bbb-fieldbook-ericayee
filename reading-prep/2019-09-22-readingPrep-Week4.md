# Reading Prep: Print II

## Questions or Observations

1. In the chapter “Letter” from _Thinking With Type_, Ellen Lupton lays out how italic letters were introduced in fifteenth-century Italy and modeled after a "casual style of handwriting" that could be written quickly. This got me thinking about how we view italics now and what they connote. Are they still the print/digital equivalent of underlining by hand? While italicization rules in English grammar seem to vary widely for indicating titles of works, the effect can also be used just for emphasis. And then as a journalism student, I try to adhere to AP Style, which does not use italics [at all](https://twitter.com/apstylebook/status/1110901868350328833).

2. This week's readings really emphasized the thought and effort that go into creating good fonts. Learning about the ins and outs of how they're made reminded me of a website I stumbled across recently called [Future Fonts](https://www.futurefonts.xyz/). Future Fonts is a marketplace for new, experimental fonts that are still in progress. The earlier in the design process you buy them, the cheaper it is and you get free updates along the way. Users give feedback to the designers as they use their fonts. I think it's really cool to be able to follow the whole process and support independent designers.

3. I thought type designer Pablo Medina's answer for the inspiration of his Bushwick typeface was interesting in light of the _Thinking With Type_ reading. He describes his typeface as an "amalgamation" of different signs and graffiti he's seen around the neighborhood. This diversity is evident in the sampling of his font pictured in the article. However, without this context I would have thought that each line was a different font. A theme in _Thinking With Type_ was the importance of consistency when designing fonts, from the curves of each letter to the spacing between them. Bushwick the Typeface is not a typical font in this way, but I see how the designer is trying to represent different facets of the neighborhood with his diversity of styles.
