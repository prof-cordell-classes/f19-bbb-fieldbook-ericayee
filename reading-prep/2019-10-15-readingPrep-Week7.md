# Reading Prep: Book Alterities

## Questions or Observations

1. In the article "A Crash Course On Altered Book,"  Lisa Vollrath writes, "Altered book artists respect books in a way that is second only to librarians." My gut feeling agrees that librarians respect books to a relatively great degree. But I wonder why we don't collectively feel the same way about authors. Not that authors have a reputation for disrespecting books, but thinking about the juxtaposition of book caretakers (i.e., librarians and book collectors) and creators (i.e., authors) regarding their relationships to books is interesting.

2. In "The 'Future Book' Is Here, but It's Not What We Expected," Craig Mod discusses how the digital books of today feel very similar to their counterparts when the Kindle launched a decade ago. The "biggest change," Mod writes, is the irrelevancy of many of Amazon's competitors now. My question is: With Amazon's almost monopoly on e-readers, who will push forward innovation in the market? Perhaps crowdfunded projets, as Mod suggests.

3. The year 2114 feels very far away to me. That's when the books in the Future Library will be published and read, if all goes well with the earth, according to the [New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/t-magazine/future-library-books.html). Will books even exist in the same form then? On the other hand, we have copies of the Gutenberg Bible from over 500 years ago, and its overall codex form is still ubiquitous. In that light, maybe 95 years is closer than I think, and the books will in fact get passed on.
